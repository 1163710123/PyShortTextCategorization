Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

1. Can we use Tensorflow backend?
Ans: Tensorflow backend was not tested. It is recommended to use Theano backend.

2. Can we use word-embedding algorithms other than Word2Vec?
Ans: Currently only Word2Vec is directly supported. However, you can
convert GloVe models into Word2Vec models. See: :doc:`tutorial_wordembed` .
