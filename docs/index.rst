   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to shorttext's documentation!
=====================================

This repository is a collection of algorithms for multi-class classification to short texts using Python.
Instead of the bag-of-words representation of texts, word-embedding algorithms with a pre-trained model are used.
Very likely I will add non-word-embedding models.
Currently, Word2Vec is implemented. This package is still *under development*, and *not stable*.
Feel free to give suggestions through the Github_ page.
