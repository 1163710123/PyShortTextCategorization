Stacked Generalization
======================

"Stacking generates the members of the stacking ensemble using several learning algorithms and subsequently
uses another algorithm to learn how to combine their outputs." It combines the classification results
of several classifiers, and combines them.

Stacking is most commonly implemented using logistic regression.
Suppose there are *K* classifiers, and *l* output labels.
